# Getting started

## What is phpReel?
It's an open-source MIT subscription-based video streaming application built on top of the Laravel Framework. In simpler terms we can say that phpReel is an application that let's you upload video content and distribute it to your users free or via a subscription.

## Story
phpReel was created by a single person, Paul Balan, and it was first developed for a [programming course website](https://nuezit.ro/) that still uses an early version of phpReel to this day. Nowadays phpReel is far more complex, integrating payments, cloud storage, themes, and so on. 

## I want to help
phpReel is getting bigger and better each day, thus with every new feature, it becomes more and more difficult to manage a product without a team. I really want to grow this project into a full-blown software company but until that day I rely entirely on the help of the community. Here is a list of things you can do to help phpReel grow:

- [Fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/phpreel/phpreel/) and contribute to it by adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving on what's already there (then submit a pull request)
- Contribute to the documentation 
- Spread the word about the project
- Just simply use it and open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/phpreel/phpreel/issues) if you find any bugs
